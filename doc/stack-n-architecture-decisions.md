Here we discuss the various choices made during implementation of this API

## MariaDB plugin vs Maxscale plugin vs external app
### MariaDB Plugin
* Design Philosophy: A MariaDB plugin allows for direct integration with the database server, enabling custom functionality to be executed within the database environment.
* Features:
  * Direct Access: Provides direct access to the database's internals, allowing for efficient execution of SQL commands based on JSON input.
  * Performance: Since it runs within the MariaDB server, it can leverage existing resources and minimize latency associated with external calls.
  * Security: Benefits from the security context of the database server, allowing for controlled access to sensitive operations.
  * Complexity: Requires knowledge of MariaDB's plugin architecture and may involve more complex development and maintenance processes.
* Use Case: Ideal for scenarios where tight integration with the database is necessary, such as custom data processing or when needing to handle complex SQL operations directly.
### MaxScale
* Design Philosophy: MaxScale is a database proxy that provides advanced routing, load balancing, and monitoring capabilities between client applications and MariaDB servers.
* Features:
  * Routing Capabilities: Can intelligently route requests based on defined rules, making it suitable for handling JSON requests and forwarding them to the appropriate backend databases.
  * Load Balancing: Supports load balancing across multiple database servers, enhancing performance and availability.
  * Plugin Architecture: Offers a flexible plugin architecture that can be extended with custom filters or routers to process JSON data before sending SQL commands to the database.
  * Latency: Introduces some latency due to being an intermediary between clients and the database, which may impact performance in high-throughput scenarios.
* Use Case: Best suited for environments where multiple databases are in use and where intelligent routing and load balancing are required. It is also useful when you want to decouple application logic from database interactions.
### External Application
* Design Philosophy: An external application can be developed separately from the database server to handle JSON input and convert it into SQL commands.
* Features:
  * Flexibility: Allows for greater flexibility in design and implementation; developers can choose any programming language or framework best suited for their needs.
  * Separation of Concerns: Keeps the database server focused solely on data storage and retrieval while offloading processing logic to a dedicated application.
  * Scalability: Can be scaled independently of the database server, allowing for better resource management in high-load situations.
  * Complexity in Integration: Requires additional work to manage connections and ensure secure communication between the application and the database.
* Use Case: Ideal for applications that require complex business logic not easily implemented as a plugin or when integrating with other services (e.g., web applications) that need to handle JSON.
### Decision : 
* MariaDB plugin
  * Why : it has been designed as an easy & simple way to consume datas in a single database. so integrating tightly with thze database, allows for the best performance
